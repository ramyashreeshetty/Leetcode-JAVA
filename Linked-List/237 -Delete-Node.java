// Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly.

// It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list.

// Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
// Output: [4,1,9]
// Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
